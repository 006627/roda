One key restriction limits image tiles to 128 pixels in each dimension; another limit (shared with profile 1) requires that the low resolution element in the image (LLD; the \"D\" is a subscript) also be 128 pixels in each dimension, facilitating the rapid construction of a thumbnail by most decompressors.","categories":["still-image"],"websites":[],"provenanceInformation":"www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","extensions":["j2c"],"mimetypes":[],"pronoms":[],"utis":[],"openFormat":true}
