This Web page provides general, introductory information about the whole family.  DTS compression algorithms do not employ perceptual encoding and have relatively high data rates, e.g., 882 kb/s (4:1 compression) for the theatrical variant, sometimes referred to as apt-X100. In the theater, the sound is played from DVD-ROM disk media and synchronized with the picture by means of a special track printed on the film. A different algorithm called Coherent Acoustics is used to compress sound when DTS is delivered in home systems.
