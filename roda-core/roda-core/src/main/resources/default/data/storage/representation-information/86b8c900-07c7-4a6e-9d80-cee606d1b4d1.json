Its baseline algorithm consists of two independent and distinct stages called modeling and encoding, based on the LOCO-I algorithm, which relies on prediction, residual modeling and context-based coding of the residuals. JPEG-LS was intended to provide a low-complexity, high quality image compression standard that could offer greater efficiency than JPEG_orig_LL.
