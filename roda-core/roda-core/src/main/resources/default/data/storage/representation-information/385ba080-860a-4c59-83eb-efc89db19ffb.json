{"description":"Lossy compression algorithm for full color and grayscale continuous-tone images that employs discrete cosine transforms (DCT) and other processes.  In baseline encoding, the 8-by-8 pixel Minimum Coded Unit (MCU) blocks that comprise the image are input sequentially; the coefficients of a single block are encoded in a zigzag manner.
