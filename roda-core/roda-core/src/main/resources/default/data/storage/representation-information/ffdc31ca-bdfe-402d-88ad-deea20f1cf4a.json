{"updatedOn":1515421588276,"description":"EWF files are a type of disk image, i.e., files that contain the contents and structure of an entire data storage device, a disk volume, or (in some cases) a computer's physical memory (RAM).  Storage devices include hard drives, floppy disks, tape drives, optical discs, or USB flash drives. The source can be such a device in its entirety or a narrower target such as a logical drive (C:\\ drive, file system, etc.) contained on, say, a hard drive.  Disk images like EWF include embedded metadata about their creation, fixity data, and other elements that provide elements in an evidence chain or audit trail.","filters":[],"categories":["any"],"relations":[{"relationType":"SPECIFIED_BY","link":"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","title":"Provenance information","objectType":"WEB"}],"id":"ffdc31ca-bdfe-402d-88ad-deea20f1cf4a","family":"fileformat","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"disclosure\">Is open format.</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\"></field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>","name":"Expert Witness Disk Image Format (EWF) Family","support":"SUPPORTED","updatedBy":"admin"}
