{"description":"File format that wraps video, audio, and other bitstreams.  This description is concerned with QuickTime as a video wrapper (generally with a synchronized audio stream), called \"movie\" files by Apple, and as a sound wrapper, especially as used by Apple's iTunes music service. QuickTime also wraps still images (QuickTime Image Files), animations not recorded as video, virtual reality, etc., and these are not discussed at this site.","support":"KNOWN","tags":[],"updatedBy":"admin","family":"fileformat","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"formatCategory\">other</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\">mov, qt, m4p, mp3, qtif, qti, qif</field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>","filters":[],"id":"65ddda5f-9b27-48b2-b924-bf92e7f8504c","updatedOn":1515421588276,"name":"QuickTime File Format","relations":[{"link":"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","title":"Sustainability of Digital Formats: Planning for Library of Congress Collections","relationType":"HAS_SOURCE","objectType":"WEB"},{"objectType":"WEB","link":"http://developer.apple.com/standards/classicquicktime.html","title":"http://developer.apple.com/standards/classicquicktime.html","relationType":"SPECIFIED_BY"},{"objectType":"WEB","link":"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/qtff.pdf","title":"https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/QuickTime/QTFF/qtff.pdf","relationType":"SPECIFIED_BY"}]}
