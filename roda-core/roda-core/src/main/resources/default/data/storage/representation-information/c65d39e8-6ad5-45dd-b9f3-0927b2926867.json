One restriction limits image tiles to 1,024 pixels in each dimension; another limit (shared with profile 0) requires that the low resolution element in the image (LLD; the \"D\" is a subscript) also be 128 pixels in each dimension, facilitating the rapid construction of a thumbnail by most decompressors.","name":"ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.
