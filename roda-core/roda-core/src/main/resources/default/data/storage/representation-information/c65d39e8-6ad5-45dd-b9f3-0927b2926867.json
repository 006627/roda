{"updatedOn":1515421588276,"description":"Implementation of JPEG 2000 Core Coding (Part 1) that constrains the use of variables in the specification (restricts the codestream) but has been designed to serve most commercial applications.  One restriction limits image tiles to 1,024 pixels in each dimension; another limit (shared with profile 0) requires that the low resolution element in the image (LLD; the \"D\" is a subscript) also be 128 pixels in each dimension, facilitating the rapid construction of a thumbnail by most decompressors.","filters":[],"categories":["still-image"],"relations":[{"relationType":"SPECIFIED_BY","objectType":"WEB","title":"Provenance information","link":"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/"}],"id":"c65d39e8-6ad5-45dd-b9f3-0927b2926867","family":"fileformat","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"disclosure\">Is open format.</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\">j2c</field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>","name":"ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.
