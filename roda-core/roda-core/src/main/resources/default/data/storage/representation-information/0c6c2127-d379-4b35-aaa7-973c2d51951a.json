{"updatedBy":"admin","family":"fileformat","tags":["moving-image"],"support":"KNOWN","description":"File format for the exchange of resolution-independent, pixel-based (bitmapped) images, intended for very high quality moving image content for theatrical distribution; DPX masters provide the input for film recording (digital images back to film for projection) or D-Cinema digital projection systems.  Each DPX file represents a single image with a single component, e.g., luma, or multiple components, e.g., red, green, blue; or Cb, Y, Cr (chrominance-luminance data).  DPX images may be produced by scanning film or by using a camera that produces a DPX output. Sound information is usually carried in a separate format although there are emerging options to carry sound data within the DPX file.","relations":[{"objectType":"WEB","link":"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","relationType":"HAS_SOURCE","title":"Sustainability of Digital Formats: Planning for Library of Congress Collections"}],"name":"Digital Moving-Picture Exchange (DPX) Format","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"formatCategory\">moving-image</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\">dpx</field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>","id":"0c6c2127-d379-4b35-aaa7-973c2d51951a","updatedOn":1515421588276,"filters":[]}
