Each DPX file represents a single image with a single component, e.g., luma, or multiple components, e.g., red, green, blue; or Cb, Y, Cr (chrominance-luminance data).  DPX images may be produced by scanning film or by using a camera that produces a DPX output. Sound information is usually carried in a separate format although there are emerging options to carry sound data within the DPX file.","filters":[],"support":"SUPPORTED","name":"Digital Moving-Picture Exchange (DPX) Format","family":"fileformat","id":"0c6c2127-d379-4b35-aaa7-973c2d51951a","relations":[],"categories":["moving-image"],"updatedOn":1515421588276,"updatedBy":"admin"}
