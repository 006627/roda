  <name>ISO/IEC 14495-1:1994 and -2:2003. Information technology -- Lossless and near-lossless compression of continuous-tone still images: Baseline and Extensions (formal name); Improved lossless JPEG (common name)</name>
  <description>Compression encoding for continuous-tone images with both lossless and near-lossless modes.  Its baseline algorithm consists of two independent and distinct stages called modeling and encoding, based on the LOCO-I algorithm, which relies on prediction, residual modeling and context-based coding of the residuals. JPEG-LS was intended to provide a low-complexity, high quality image compression standard that could offer greater efficiency than JPEG_orig_LL. </description>
