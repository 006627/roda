{"updatedOn":1515421588276,"description":"Implementation of JPEG 2000 Core Coding (Part 1) that constrains the use of variables in the specification (restricts the codestream) to serve low-complexity applications, e.g., cell phones and PDAs (Personal Digital Assistants).  One key restriction limits image tiles to 128 pixels in each dimension; another limit (shared with profile 1) requires that the low resolution element in the image (LLD; the \"D\" is a subscript) also be 128 pixels in each dimension, facilitating the rapid construction of a thumbnail by most decompressors.","filters":[],"categories":["still-image"],"relations":[{"link":"http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","title":"Provenance information","objectType":"WEB","relationType":"SPECIFIED_BY"}],"id":"aa8488a9-b567-4f9f-a629-15c9518744dd","family":"fileformat","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"disclosure\">Is open format.</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\">j2c</field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>","name":"ISO/IEC 15444-1:2000.
