DV video signals are compressed using discrete cosine transforms (DCT) within each frame.  DV does not use frame-to-frame temporal encoding. Later, similar but higher quality elaborations were offered by SONY (DVCAM) and Panasonic (DVCPRO, DVCPRO-50, DVCPRO HD), used in professional television production.","tags":["moving-image"],"updatedBy":"admin","family":"fileformat"}
