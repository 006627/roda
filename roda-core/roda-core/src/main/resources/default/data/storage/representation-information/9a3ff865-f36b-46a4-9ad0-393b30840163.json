The basic component of CDF is a software programming interface that is a device-independent view of the CDF data model.  The application developer is insulated from the actual physical file format for reasons of conceptual simplicity, device independence, and future expandability.  CDF files created on any given platform can be transported to any other platform onto which CDF is ported and used with any CDF tools or layered applications.","extras":"<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?><metadata><field name=\"disclosure\">www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/</field><field name=\"documentation\">http://cdaweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/cdf33_1_2/Documentation/cdf33ifd.pdf, http://cdaweb.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/pub/software/cdf/dist/</field><field name=\"filenameExtension\">cdf</field><field name=\"internetMediaType\"></field><field name=\"pronomPUID\"></field></metadata>"}
