{"id":"0c6c2127-d379-4b35-aaa7-973c2d51951a","name":"Digital Moving-Picture Exchange (DPX) Format","definition":"File format for the exchange of resolution-independent, pixel-based (bitmapped) images, intended for very high quality moving image content for theatrical distribution; DPX masters provide the input for film recording (digital images back to film for projection) or D-Cinema digital projection systems.  Each DPX file represents a single image with a single component, e.g., luma, or multiple components, e.g., red, green, blue; or Cb, Y, Cr (chrominance-luminance data).  DPX images may be produced by scanning film or by using a camera that produces a DPX output. Sound information is usually carried in a separate format although there are emerging options to carry sound data within the DPX file.","categories":["moving-image"],"websites":[],"provenanceInformation":"www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","extensions":["dpx"],"mimetypes":[],"pronoms":[],"utis":[],"openFormat":true}
