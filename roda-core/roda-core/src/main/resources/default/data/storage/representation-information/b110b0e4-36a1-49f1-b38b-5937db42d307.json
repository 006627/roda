The textual representation of MPEG-4 content has high-level abstractions, XMT-O, that allow authors to exchange their content easily with other authors or authoring tools, while at the same time preserving semantic intent. XMT also has low level textual representations, XMT-A, covering the full scope and function of MPEG-4. XMT-O is designed to facilitate interoperability with the Synchronized Multimedia Integration Language (SMIL) 2.0, and also with Extensible 3D specification, X3D, developed as the next generation of Virtual Reality Modeling Language (VRML).","name":"ISO/IEC FCD 14496-11, Information technology -- Coding of audio-visual objects -- Part 11: Scene description and application engine; ISO/IEC 14496-11/Amd 4, XMT and MPEG-J extensions.
