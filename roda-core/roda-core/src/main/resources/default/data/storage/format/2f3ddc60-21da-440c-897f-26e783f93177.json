Information technology -- Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information (formal name); MPEG-2  (common name)","definition":"Video or picture encoding defined by the MPEG-2 family of specifications.  The key techniques employed in the MPEG-2 codec include intra-frame Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coding and motion-compensated inter-frame prediction.  All MPEG-2 streams (picture, sound or data) are based on elementary streams; in the case of picture (video), the elementary stream contains compressed frame images, plus sequence headers and other data needed to decode the stream. Picture and sound elementary streams are combined to produce single-program streams, which may be further combined with other programs in a multi-program transport stream.","categories":["moving-image"],"websites":[],"provenanceInformation":"www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/","extensions":["mpg","mpeg"],"mimetypes":[],"pronoms":[],"utis":[],"openFormat":true}
