	<h1>What is RODA?</h1>

	<h2>An open-source digital repository designed for "humans"</h2>

	<p>

		RODA is a complete digital repository that delivers functionality for all the main functional units of the OAIS reference model. RODA is capable of ingesting, managing and providing access to the various types of digital objects produced by large corporations or public bodies. RODA is based on open-source technologies and is supported by existing standards such as the OAIS, METS, EAD, DC and PREMIS.
	</p>

	<h2>What's so different about RODA?</h2>
	<p>
		RODA was designed to be used by <emph>humans</emph>, not hard core techies. Its graphical user interface is easy to use by any anyone (archivist, librarian, policy maker, etc.), yet powerful enough to enable a preservation expert to execute a highly complex preservation action over existing content.
	</p>


	<h2>What preservation strategies does it support?</h2>

	<p>

		RODA's architecture and  technologies are independent from any specific hardware vendor. Its data model is rich enough to support any preservation strategy you may wish to implement, e.g. migration, emulation, or encapsulation. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The extendible nature of RODA enables it to be enhanced, reconfigured or updated to comply with new requirements, file formats, or preservation tools. Preservation metadata is automatically managed by the repository. This ensures authenticity of digital content while providing evidence for all events that take place in the repository. Addtinally, its worth mentioning that all actions performed in the repository are logged for security and accountability reasons.
	</p>
	<p>
		Preservation management within RODA is handled by preservation actions. A preservation manager is able to select the objects and the preservation actions that she wants to apply. Preservation actions include format converters, checksum verifications, format validators, characterisation tools, etc.

				<h3>Ingest</h3>
				<p>Ingest is composed by a configurable multi-step workflow that validates submitted information and also extracts technical metadata from ingested files. The ingest process also validates formats according to the preservation policy in place and includes both automatic and human quality assurance steps.</p>

	<h2>Supported file formats</h2>

	<p>RODA supports any file format and any metadata schema (as long as it is based on XML). Characterisation tools are run during ingest to capture technical metadata from original files. Specialised format migration tools can be run over existing content to make it more apt for preservation or consumption by end-users with modern access technologies.
	</p>


	<h2>Trustworthiness - ISO 16363 Certification</h2>

	<p>
		Establishing trustworthiness of digital repositories is a major concern of the digital preservation community. The certification of a repository aims to ensure stakeholders that threats and oportunities that surrond the environment of the repository are understandable and managed. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The certification of a repository according to ISO 16363 transcends greatly the functions provided by the software. This includes aspects related to human resources, training, financial sustainability, information security, etc. However, RODA focuses greatly on authenticity which is a pre-requisite for trustworthiness. The processes it aims to support are aligned with the functional units and terminology outlined by OAIS, which greatly simplifies adoption and usability.
