	<h2>Developers mailing list</h2>
	<p>
		The developers mailing list is intended for programmers that are (or would like to be) part of the development of RODA features. Itâ€™s a place to share ideas and discuss code changes to the open source platform. Join other developers to shape the evolution of the RODA software. The RODA community depends on its member to frame functional requirements and high-level architecture, and to facilitate programming, testing and documentation of the project.
