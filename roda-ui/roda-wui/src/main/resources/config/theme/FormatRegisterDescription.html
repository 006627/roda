<p>Representation information is any information required to understand and render both the digital material and the
    associated metadata. Digital objects are stored as bitstreams, which are not understandable to a human being without
    further data to interpret them. Representation information is the extra structural or semantic information, which
    converts raw data into something more meaningful.

Representation information should contain as much structure and semantic information as is required for a defined
    community (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Designated_community">Designated Community</a> in OAIS
    terminology) to access the information stored within a digital object.

Representation information is not the same thing as metadata which describes data in administrative, descriptive,
    technical, structural and preservation terms. The term can be applied to all levels of abstraction and refers to
    both the structural and semantic composition. It can therefore be recursive and is dependent on the knowledge base
    of the designated community.

This page allows the preservation expert to define <a href="#theme/Representation_Information.md">Representation
    Information</a> and to link it to Intellectual Entities in the repository.
