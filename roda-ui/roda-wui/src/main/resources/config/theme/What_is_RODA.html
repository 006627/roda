	<h1>What is RODA?</h1>

	<h2>An open-source digital repository designed for "humans"</h2>

	<p>RODA is a complete digital repository that delivers
		functionality for all the main functional units of the OAIS reference
		model. RODA is capable of ingesting, managing and providing access to
		the various types of digital objects produced by large corporations or
		public bodies. RODA is based on open-source technologies and is
		supported by existing standards such as the OAIS, METS, EAD, DC and
		PREMIS.</p>

	<h2>What's so different about RODA?</h2>
	<p>
		RODA was designed to be used by <em>humans</em> , not hard core
		techies. Its graphical user interface is easy to use by any anyone
		(archivist, librarian, policy maker, etc.), yet powerful enough to
		enable a preservation expert to execute a highly complex preservation
		action over existing content.
	</p>

	<h2>What preservation strategies does it support?</h2>

	<p>RODA's architecture and technologies are independent from any
		specific hardware vendor. Its data model is rich enough to support any
		preservation strategy you may wish to implement, e.g. migration,
		emulation, or encapsulation.</p>
	<p>The extendible nature of RODA enables it to be enhanced,
		reconfigured or updated to comply with new requirements, file formats,
		or preservation tools. Preservation metadata is automatically managed
		by the repository. This ensures authenticity of digital content while
		providing evidence for all events that take place in the repository.
		Additionally, its worth mentioning that all actions performed in the
		repository are logged for security and accountability reasons.</p>
	<p>Preservation management within RODA is handled by preservation
		actions. A preservation manager is able to select the objects and the
		preservation actions that she wants to apply. Preservation actions
		include format converters, checksum verifications, format validators,
		characterization tools, etc.</p>

				<h3>Ingest</h3>
				<p>Ingest is composed by a configurable multi-step workflow that
					validates submitted information and also extracts technical
					metadata from ingested files. The ingest process also validates
					formats according to the preservation policy in place and includes
					both automatic and human quality assurance steps.</p>

				<h3>Data management</h3>
				<p>All descriptive metadata formats are supported. Off-the-shelf
					the repository brings templates for EAD 2002, EAD 3 and DC. This
					makes RODA ideal for memory institutions of different natures
					including by adding support to their specific metadata profiles.</p>

	<h2>Supported file formats</h2>

	<p>RODA supports any file format and any metadata schema (as long
		as it is based on XML). Characterization tools are run during ingest
		to capture technical metadata from original files. Specialized format
		migration tools can be run over existing content to make it more apt
		for preservation or consumption by end-users with modern access
		technologies.</p>


	<h2>Trustworthiness - ISO 16363 Certification</h2>

	<p>Establishing trustworthiness of digital repositories is a major
		concern of the digital preservation community. The certification of a
		repository aims to ensure stakeholders that threats and opportunities
		that surround the environment of the repository are understandable and
		managed.</p>
	<p>The certification of a repository according to ISO 16363
		transcends greatly the functions provided by the software. This
		includes aspects related to human resources, training, financial
		sustainability, information security, etc. However, RODA focuses
		greatly on authenticity which is a pre-requisite for trustworthiness.
		The processes it aims to support are aligned with the functional units
		and terminology outlined by OAIS, which greatly simplifies adoption
		and usability.</p>
