<p>Assessment is the process of determining whether records and other
	materials have permanent (archival) value. Assessment may be done at the
	collection, creator, series, file, or item level. Assessment can take
	place prior to donation and prior to physical transfer, at or after
	accessioning. The basis of assessment decisions may include a number of
	factors, including the records' provenance and content, their
	authenticity and reliability, their order and completeness, their
	condition and costs to preserve them, and their intrinsic value.</p>
