	<h1>Pre-ingest instructions</h1>

	<p>The pre-ingest process depicts the ability of a Producer to
		create Submission Information Packages (SIP) containing both data and
		metadata (in a well-defined structure) in order to submit them to the
		repository for ingest. The SIPs created are expected to comply to the
		policies established by (or negotiated with) the repository. The
		pre-ingest process usually comprises some or all of the following
		activities:</p>



	<h2>1. Submission agreement</h2>

	<p> This activity consists of the definition of the terms,
		pre-conditions and requirements for content, and accompanying
		information (e.g. metadata, documentation, contracts, etc.), to be
		sent to the repository by the Producer. It is materialised in a written agreement between
		the Producer and the Repository that specifies the type of content and
		all the legal and technical requirements that both parties are
		expected to comply.</p>

			Agreement Template</button>
	</div-->

	<h2>2. Classification plan</h2>

	<p> During the signing of the submission agreement, the Producer must have agreed 
		to a base Classification Scheme (or list of Collections) on which
		she will have explicit authorisation to deposit new information.</p>
	<p>
	The base Classification Scheme is usually created by the Repository and can be downloaded in this section in 
	machine readable format. The downloaded file can be loaded into <a href="http://rodain.roda-community.org">RODA-in</a> to better
	arrange and prepare Submission Information Packages before transferring them to the repository to be ingested.

	<h2>3. Submission Information Packages (SIP)</h2>

	<p>
		This activity consists of preparing of one or more Submission
		Information Packages (SIP) according to the technical and
		non-technical requirements defined on the Submission Agreement. To
		facilitate the creation of SIPs, Producers may take advantage of the
		RODA-in tool. The tool and its documentation are available at <a
			href="http://rodain.roda-community.org" title="rodain">http://rodain.roda-community.org</a>
	</p>

	</div>

	<h2>4. Transfer of materials</h2>

	<p>This activity consists of the  transfer of Submission
		Information Packages (SIP) from the Producer to the Repository. SIPs
		are temporarily stored on a quarantine area waiting to be processed by
		the repository.</p>

	<p>There are several ways Producers can use to transfer their SIPs to the
		repository. These include, but are not limited to the following
		options:</p>

	<div class="row full_width skip_padding">
		<div class="col_4">
			<h3>HTTP transfer</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Connect to the repository Web site and use the credentials
					provided in order to log in.</li>
				<li>2. Access the menu Ingest/Transfer and enter the folder with your username (or create the folder if necessary).</li>
				<li>3. Upload all your SIPs to the new folder.</li>
				<li>4. Inform the Repository that the material is ready to be ingested.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>

		<div class="col_4">
			<h3>FTP transfer</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Connect to [ftp://address] and use the credentials
					provided by the Repository in order to log in.</li>
				<li>2. Create a folder to hold the SIPs you which to be part of
					a single ingest batch (Optional).</li>
				<li>3. Copy all the created SIPs to the new folder.</li>
				<li>4. Inform the Repository that the material is ready to be ingested.</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
		<div class="col_4">
			<h3>External media transfer</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>1. Save SIPs to an external media (e.g. CD, USB disk, etc.)</li>
				<li>2. Deliver it at the following address: [Repository
					address]</li>
			</ol>
		</div>
	</div>

	<h2>Ingest process</h2>

	<p>After transfer, SIPs will be selected for ingest by the Repository staff.
		The Ingest process provides services and functions to accept
		SIPs from Producers and prepare the	contents for archival storage and management.</p>

	<p>Ingest functions include receiving SIPs, performing quality
		assurance on SIPs, generating an Archival Information Package (AIP)
		which complies with the Repository's data formatting and documentation
		standards, extracting Descriptive Information from the AIPs for
		inclusion in the Repository catalogue, and coordinating updates to
		Archival Storage and Data Management.</p>
