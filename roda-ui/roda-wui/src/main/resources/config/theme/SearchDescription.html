<p>Users are capable of finding Intellectual Entity (IE),
	Representations and Files by making use of the discovery services
	available in this page. The discovery services are divided by resource
	type and use different properties to support its discovery and
	location. For example, IEs can be found by searching on descriptive
	metadata (multiple schemas are supported per IE). Representations can
	be found by ID, type, size, and number of files. Files can be found
	using technical atributes such as mimetype, PRONOM identifier, size,
	etc.</p>
