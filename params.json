RODA is capable of ingesting, managing and providing access to the various types of digital objects produced by large corporations or public bodies. RODA is based on open-source technologies and is supported by existing standards such as the OAIS, METS, EAD and PREMIS.\r\n\r\n## Some technical information about RODA\r\n\r\n* Uses native file system or Fedora 4 for digital object storage\r\n* Uses any XML format as descriptive metadata\r\n* Uses PREMIS for preservation metadata\r\n* Has a configurable multi-step ingestion workflow\r\n* Supports LDAP and CAS for authentication & authorization\r\n* Supports pluggable preservation actions\r\n* Has a user friendly graphical user interface based on GWT\r\n\r\nFor more information, please fell free to visit RODA website:\r\n**<http://www.roda-community.org>**\r\n\r\n## Install and run\r\n\r\n### Demo mode (based on docker containers)\r\n\r\n#### Windows and MacOS X\r\n\r\nInstall [Kitematic Docker Toolbox](https://kitematic.com), search for `keeps/roda` and create and run the container. Click on the top-right button to open RODA (it might take a minute to initialize).\r\n\r\n![Create container](doc/images/kitematic_search.png \"Create container\")\r\n\r\n![Open RODA](doc/images/kitematic_open.png \"Open RODA\")\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Linux\r\n\r\nOn Linux, as Kitematic Docker Toolbox is not yet available, use the following instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Install docker for your system: https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/\r\n2. Pull or update to the latest roda container, on the command line run:  `sudo docker pull keeps/roda`\r\n3. Run the container: `sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -v ~/.roda:/root/.roda keeps/roda`\r\n4. Access RODA on your browser: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)\r\n\r\nNOTE: the docker commands only need `sudo` if your user does not belong to the `docker` group.\r\n\r\n### Production mode\r\n\r\nTo install RODA from base, i.e. without containers, see the [base install instructions](INSTALL.md).\r\n\r\n## Quick start\r\n\r\nPlease log in with the following credentials:\r\n* Username: admin\r\n* Password: roda\r\n\r\nWith this you will have access to all features.\r\n\r\nThen you can start using RODA:\r\n\r\n1. Go to Catalogue and click the button **NEW**, select Dublin Core and fill the title of your new collection\r\n2. Go to **Ingest > Transfer** and upload files (e.g. PDF) or SIPs made by [RODA-in](http://rodain.roda-community.org/). SIPs will have metadata while PDFs wont. To know how to use RODA-in [watch the tutorials](http://rodain.roda-community.org/).\r\n3. After upload, select the SIPs or files to ingest on the checkbox and click the button **PROCESS** on the sidebar under the section Ingest.\r\n4. Now configure the ingest workflow, select the SIP format, if you upload a file select **Uploaded file/folder**, if you uploaded a SIP select the SIP format (E-ARK or Bagit).\r\n5. Under the **Parent Object** you can select the new collection you created above\r\n6. After configuring ingest click the **CREATE** button\r\n7. Now ingest will start and you can see the status of it at **Ingest > Process**, you can also inspect the status by clicking the table row\r\n8. When finished you can go to **Catalogue** or **Search** to find your new ingested content\r\n\r\n\r\n## Developers\r\n\r\nTo start developing for RODA check the [Developer guide](https://github.com/keeps/roda/wiki/Developer-guide) which has information on:\r\n\r\n1.
