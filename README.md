**This page is under construction!**

RODA source code is migrating to GitHub, but before we are Mavenizing and making it a lot slimmer.

RODA will be at GitHub until the end of July 2012, but, if you can't wait, checkout our current development site at:

http://redmine.keep.pt/projects/roda-public/wiki

Also, take a look at the new RODA site at http://roda-community.org

Stay tuned!
