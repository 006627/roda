RODA

**This page is under construction!**

RODA source code is migrating to GitHub, but before we are Mavenizing and making it a lot slimmer.

This process is taking more time than antecipated, but we expect that RODA will be at GitHub in March 2013. If you can't wait, checkout our current development site at:

http://redmine.keep.pt/projects/roda-public/wiki

Also, take a look at the new RODA site at http://roda-community.org

Stay tuned!
