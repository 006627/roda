  * RODA was released to GitHub
    (https://github.com/keeps/roda/issues/2)
  * RODA was completly mavenized (installer creation included,
    using the maven profile "create-installer")
    (https://github.com/keeps/roda/issues/1)
  * Scheduler was storing dates incorrectly
    (https://github.com/keeps/roda/issues/3)
  * String formater was used in some parts of the code to build
    SQL statements and proved to be a problem with different
    locales (when different characters are used as separator
    for floating point values)
