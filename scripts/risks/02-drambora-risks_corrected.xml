<TD>
- Repository maintains the use of the file path from the digital object’s original environment as the identifier for the archived object, resulting in two distinct objects that originated from different locations sharing the duplicate identifer “/Documents and Settings/John Smith/Document.pdf”
- Identifiers generated at ingest consist of the timestamp at the point of ingest, but two ingest systems operate simultaneously and duplicate identifiers are consequently applied </TD>
