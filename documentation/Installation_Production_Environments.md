# Going into production

Every production environment is tailored for the specific requirements of the repository to be made available.

Consideration on data volume (size, number of object, heterogeneity of formats), infrastructure type, designated community, high availability requirements, systems to integrated and so forth need to be taken into account when designing  the architecture to put into production.

Many of the production environments we have made involve the use of docker containers, as shown in this instructions. A startup example is available [here](https://github.com/keeps/roda/blob/master/deploys/cloud/docker-compose.yaml).

If you need help scaling your system into production, we provide commercial services for installation, maintenance, support, training, data migration, system integration, custom development and digital preservation consultancy. Please contact [sales@keep.pt](mailto:sales@keep.pt).
